# Butterfly-Species-Classifier
This project is an AI-powered butterfly species identification system built using TensorFlow/Keras and a Streamlit web interface. It allows users to upload a butterfly image and instantly predicts its species from a trained deep learning model.


Features

🤖 Deep learning model trained on 75+ butterfly species

✅ Detects whether the uploaded image is a butterfly or not

🔍 Shows top prediction with confidence score

📊 Displays other likely species for better insights

🌐 Simple Streamlit-based frontend for easy interaction
